# Numpy

We'll start this module with a more thorough introduction on Numpy, as we'll be
needing it for several assignments this week. Numpy provides efficient
implementations of mathematical and statistical computations that Pandas uses to
manipulate and analyze data. By understanding Numpy's array operations, masking,
indexing, and broadcasting, you can better understand how Pandas works and
leverage its capabilities.

Download the Jupyter notebook on Numpy [here](data/numpy.ipynb).

*Make sure to do this introduction first, as it will cover things needed both for
ML1 and PDP later in the module.*
