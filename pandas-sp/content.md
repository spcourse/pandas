# Pandas

Learn to work with *Pandas*, the most popular Python library for processing tabular data. Download the notebook [here](../pandas/data/pandas.ipynb) and the test file [here](../pandas/data/tests.py).

> Note: In the notebook occasionally compares `pandas` to `numpy`. If you happen to know `numpy` this can be helpful, but otherwise ignore those remarks. You don't need to know `numpy` for this assignment.
