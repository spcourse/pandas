# Mushrooms

The module consists of two main parts. First you will learn how to use a library called `Seaborn` to inspect and analyze data. Then, you will inspect and analyze a dataset, and use that information to answer questions about the data. We're more interested in steps you took to answer the questions than the answers themselves.
